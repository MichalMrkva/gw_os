# Giggle Watt OS
This is a project where I am learning the basics of operating system development. For now, I'm browsing this blog [[ref]](https://os.phil-opp.com/) and learning through it. After I finish the blog, I would like to develop the OS further so that I can better learn the RUST programming language and expand my horizons in this area of programming.
